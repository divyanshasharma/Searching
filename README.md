# Searching
This is GUI project in which we have implemented Searching algorithms 
Algorithms used are:<br>
Linear search<br>
Binary Search<br>
Breadth First Search<br>
Depth First Search<br>
Hashing Technique<br>

# About the Project:<br>

1.The project is implemented using HTML, CSS for User Interface (Front-end) and JavaScript for back-end. Additional stylesheets are used from Bootstrap.<br> 

2.For each algorithm, the user input format is specified in the alert dialog box. Make sure you enter one array element at a time when as asked.<br>

3.When run, the output (key element if exist) or ordering of visited vertices (in case of BFS & DFS) are displayed in a separate blank page.<br>

4.Each implemented algorithm has a different webpage where the user has the following options:<br>
  -> Run the algorithm for a particular input<br>
  -> View the algorithm<br>
  -> View the graph for the algorithm.<br>
5. Rest, the user is free to explore the project.
